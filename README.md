# 1D-Digital-Filtering
A VHDL implementation of digital filtering in 1 dimension. This code was written with my partner Bretton Scarbrough for KU's EECS 443, Digital Logic Design. Here, we implement an averaging filter and a low pass filter with the specific goal of filtering out a high-frequency, low-amplitude signal from a desired low-frequency, high-amplitude signal. In practice, this sort of design could be used to remove high-frequency, low-amplitude noise from digital communications, and more generally, from any signal.

We used principles from digital logic design and digital signal processing to achieve this. This design implements the 'transposed form' of the discrete convolution circuit that is plastered in many places on the internet. We wrote all code entirely from scratch but used some reference diagrams and files as reference.
